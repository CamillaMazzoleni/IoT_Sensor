Electronics project of a biomedical sensor

## MAX86916
This GitHub project contains a library for configuring registers and reading data from the MAX86916 sensor to calculate heart rate (HR) using a peak detection algorithm. The MAX86916 is a highly integrated optical sensor module that can be used for pulse oximetry and heart rate monitoring. The library provided in this project simplifies the process of interfacing with the sensor and extracting the HR information using an efficient peak detection algorithm. The library can be easily integrated into an existing codebase, and the project also includes sample code to demonstrate the usage of the library.
